# IP Address Analyzer 🔍

A comprehensive Python tool for analyzing IP addresses with detailed network information and binary representations.

## 📋 Overview

This IP Address Analyzer is a powerful Python utility that processes IP addresses from a text file and provides detailed network analysis including binary conversion, IP classification, private/public identification, subnet masking, and network/host identification.

## ✨ Features

- **IP Validation** - Verify correct IP address format and structure
- **Binary Conversion** - Convert IP addresses to 8-bit binary representation
- **IP Classification** - Identify IP classes (A, B, C, D, E)
- **Private/Public Detection** - Determine if IP is private or public
- **Default Subnet Mask** - Calculate default mask based on IP class
- **Binary Mask Conversion** - Convert subnet masks to binary format
- **Network ID Calculation** - Extract network portion from IP address
- **Network/Host ID Template** - Visual representation of network vs host bits

## 🚀 Installation
